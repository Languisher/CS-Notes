## Bits, Bytes and Words
Computer memories are composed of :
• **bits**, each capable of holding either the value 0 or the value 1.
• **bytes**, grouping together **bits** and treated as a unit in order to store a wider range of values. Usually, each **bytes** contains eight **bits**, storing unsigned integers from 0 to 255 or signed integers from -128 to 127.
• **words**, taking two or more **bytes** and treat them as if they were a single, larger unit of memory, in order to store even larger values.

Note : Even though a word contains 4 bytes, it has only one address.

## Location in memory
1. Each location in memory is identified by a unique address. 
2. Each location in memory contains a value.

## Addresses vs Names
- As it is diﬀicult to remember the real addresses, the high-level languages provide the ability to refer
to memory locations by name (**variables**) rather than by address. This is done by the _compiler_. 
- The _hardware_ still accesses memory locations using addresses.
