## 指针变量的内容

### 变量

一个**变量**的值就是分配给这个变量的*内存位置所存储的数值*。

### 间接访问
单目操作符 `*` **解引用**：通过一个指针访问它所指向的地址的过程

⚠️注意：只有当执行 **间接访问** 操作时，才会实际访问它所指向的位置。
## Declaration and Initialization

### Declaration

```c
int *a; // Declaration : a pointer to an integer.
float *a;
```
Declaring two or more pointer variables : 
```c
int *a, *b, *c; // Correct
int *a, b, c; // Wrong, two integers with one pointer
```
### Values and their Types

The type of a value is not something inherent in the value itself but depends on how it is used. The type of a value cannot be determined simply by examining its bits.

Thus, declaring a variable to be a `float` causes the compiler to generate _floating-point instructions_ when accessing it.

```c
// Two ways of pointing according to the type of the value.

int  a = 112, b = -1; 
int *c = &a;

float  d = 3.14; 
float *e = &d;
```
### Address and Indirection
Pointers are initialized with the _addresses of other variables_.
```c
int a, *d;
d = &a; // Passing the address of a to d
// In this way, *d would access to the value which it points to (in this case, the value of a)
```

With initialization in the declaration :
```c
char *message = "Hello world!";
// The value is assigned to message (the pointer variable) rather than *message
// It equals to :

char *message;
message = "Hello world!";
```
### Uninitialized and illegal pointer

⚠️ 注意：Don’t access a location that is outside of the memory allocated to your program. (**Bus error**)
A very common error : Without initialization, two cases :
- the initial value of a will be an illegal address, and the assignment will cause a fault that terminates the program.
- the value of a legal address at that location is changed, even though you had not intended to change it.
```c
int *a; /* Wrong, where does a point? */
...
*a = 12;
```
### NULL pointer
**NULL pointer** : pointer value that does not point to anything at all. 
- To make a pointer variable NULL you *assign it the value zero*, 
- To test whether a pointer variable is NULL you compare it to zero.

⚠️ 注意：Don't perform an indirection on a NULL pointer.

> Example : A function whose job is to search an array for a specific value may return a pointer to the array element that was found. If no element in the array contained the right value, a NULL pointer could be returned instead.
> Note : Although this technique is commonly used in C programs, it violates a software engineering principle. A safer strategy is to have the function return two separate values: the first is a status value indicating the result of the operations, and the second is the pointer, which is used only when the status indicates that a match was found.

No matter how your machine handles dereferencing a NULL pointer, it is a good idea to *explicitly initialize all your pointer variables*, such as initialized to `NULL`.

### Pointer Constants

⚠️ 注意：Indirection can only be performed on expressions of type pointer.

```c
*100 = 25; /* Wrong */
*(int *)100 = 25; /* Assign 25 to location 100 */
```

### Pointers to Pointers
- Declaration : `int **`, `*` has right-to-left associativity

	```c
	int   a = 12;
	int   *b = &a;
	int   **c = &b; /* Pointers to pointers */
	```
	
	- `**c` = `*(*c)` = `*(c 指向的位置=b)` = `b 指向的位置`= `a`

## 指针、间接引用与左值
### L-values of Pointers
Pointer variables could be L-values, because they are variables, their moving their location make sense.
```c
int a;
int *d = &a;

d = d + 1; /* 指向 d 目前地址的下一位 */

*d  = 10 - *d; /* d 指向的 a 将 10 - *d 作为其新值 */
d = 10 - *d; /* -> ???, FALSE, specifies that an integer quantity (10 - *d) be stored in a pointer variable，而 d 作为左值时期待传入（相对）地址 */
```

| Expression | Indicated Location |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| `a`          | `a`                  |
| `d`          | `d`                 |
| `*d`        | `a`                  |

⚠️ 注意：请深刻理解 **左值和右值** 的概念，详情请见 [L-value and R-value](Basic%20concepts/L-value%20and%20R-value.md)
### Pointer Expressions
```c
char  ch = 'a';
char *cp = &ch;
```

基本原则：
- `cp = &ch`
- `*cp = ch`
- `++` > `*` > `+`

## Examples
